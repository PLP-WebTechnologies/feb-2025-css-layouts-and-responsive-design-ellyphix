      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With HTML, you can structure content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, lists, images, and more. It forms the backbone of all websites and is essential for any web developer to learn. HTML is designed to be readable by both humans and machines. Each tag represents a different type of content, allowing for semantic structure and better accessibility. Over the years, HTML has evolved, with HTML5 introducing new features such as audio, video, semantic tags, and more to help developers build rich, accessible, and interactive websites more easily and effectively.</p>

      <h2>Understanding CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout of HTML content. CSS allows you to apply styles like colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and more, making your web pages look attractive and polished. You can use inline styles, internal style sheets, or external CSS files. Modern CSS also supports responsive design through media queries, animations using keyframes, and layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid. By separating structure (HTML) from style (CSS), developers can maintain code more easily and ensure consistency across a website. CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind further speed up the development process with pre-defined classes and responsive utilities.</p>

    <section id="layout">
      <h2>Designing Layouts with Flexbox & Grid</h2>
      <p>Flexbox and CSS Grid are two powerful layout systems in CSS. Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts, aligning items in a row or column, while CSS Grid handles two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns). These systems make it easier to create complex, responsive designs without relying on floats or positioning. With Flexbox, you can easily center items, distribute space evenly, or align items at the end or beginning of a container. Grid lets you define areas, auto-size columns, and use named grid lines. Both systems offer a modern, efficient way to build layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.</p>

      <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
      <p>Responsive design ensures that web content adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors. This is achieved using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries in CSS. Media queries let you apply different styles based on screen width, height, orientation, resolution, and more. A mobile-first approach — designing for smaller screens first — is now the standard. Responsive design improves user experience, reduces bounce rates, and increases engagement. It’s also vital for SEO, as search engines prioritize mobile-friendly websites in search results.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Mastering HTML and CSS is the first step toward becoming a proficient web developer. From understanding the basic structure of web pages to creating elegant layouts and responsive designs, these two technologies lay the foundation for modern web development. As the web continues to evolve, staying up to date with HTML and CSS techniques is essential. Practice regularly, experiment with layouts, and don't shy away from building complex, multi-sectioned projects that challenge your understanding of layout, alignment, and responsiveness. Happy coding!</p>
